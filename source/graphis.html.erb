  <h1>Archigraphia Redux</h1>

  <p>To celebrate the fortieth anniversay of <i>Archigraphia</i>, Richard Poulin was asked by <i>Graphis</i> to revisit the concept with a survey of 21st century design and architecture. Featuring over 150 different designers, architects, and artists from over 40 countries, <i>Archigraphia Redux</i> demonstrates how the environment we experience relies heavily on graphic design  to communicate information, shape our perception, and enliven our lives.</p>

  <p>This work was completed at Poulin + Morris Inc.</p>
