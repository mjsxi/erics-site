  <h1>Skin: Nakedly Beautiful</h1>
  <p>My senior thesis at The University of the Arts was an 80-page book on the topic of skin. My goal was to portray the paradox
and beauty of something everyone has, and knows little about. What can science learn from this and are there benefits that
remain undiscovered? This factual book was written to provoke,
and answer these questions on a subject so common, yet
frequently overlooked.</p>
