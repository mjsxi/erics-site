  <h1>WAIT</h1>
  <p>To cope with a heart-wrenching breakup with my significant other, I documented photographs and love letters we shared in a 24-page book. The personal narrative contrasts memories, love, and themes of our relationship with how they
relate to the breakup and following months of recomposure.

<p>The different meaning of words through love and heartbreak influenced the design of this book heavily. I wanted to explore the opposites and similarites that occur when a couple first starts dating versus when they break up. For example, the words, "I love you" have a significantly different meaning when said at the beginning of a relationship than the end.
