  <h1>Bone Machine</h1>
  <p>Challenged with designing a new font, I aimed to create a beautiful humanist sans serif that reads best in text at 8pt. This included complete upper and lower case, special characters, and punctuation, in both Regular
and Oblique. The typeface's name comes from the Pixies' song, but accurately represents the humanist, but structured, anatomy of the typeface.</p>
