  <h1>Bone Machine</h1>
  <p>Challenged with designing a new font from scratch, I thought about some are some charicteristics of my favorite typefaces. Clean, friendly, simple, legible, was the common theme. Over the course of 3 months, I designed a lightweight humanist sans
serif, designed to read best at 8pt. This included upper and lower case, all special characters, and punctuation, for both Regular
and Oblique styles.</p>
